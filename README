CROC - Finding chromosomic clusters in genomes
==============================================================================

CROC is a tool that aims to help in the identification and analysis
of genomic gene clusters. This method has been successfully used before in the
identification of chromosomal clusters in different eukaryotic species and make
use of serialized hypergeometric distribution tests in a sliding window approach


==============================================================================
Requirements
==============================================================================

CROC is written in Perl. So it should run in every OS with Perl. If you experience
problems using it, please, send an email to <pignatelli_mig[AT]gva.es>

The code for hypergeometric distribution tests is written in C and loaded in the
Perl script via the 'Inline::C' Perl module. If you encounter problems executing this
software, you can use an "all Perl" version of this module with the "--allPerl"
command line option when invoking the script.

==============================================================================
Installation
==============================================================================

Download the file croc-<VERSION>.tar.gz
Unpack it and "cd" into the created directory
Altenatively, you can make a soft link of the executable file (croc.pl) in a path directory.

To view all available options type:
$ ./croc.pl -h
or
$ perl croc.pl -h

This distribution comes with already available genomes and samples to test the script in the
"Species" and "Datasets" folders.


===============================================================================
Formats
===============================================================================

+ Sample file: Should be a file containing a list of genes (1 per line).
+ Reference file: Should contain a first block of lines having the chromosome names and its length separated by a tab character.
                   After that, a blank line.
                   Finally, another block of lines describing the genomic features (f.e. genes). These lines must have the following fields separated by tabs:
                   <ID> <Chr> <Start> <End> <Name>
